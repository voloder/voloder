Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer based in Konjic, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Gaining interest in programming since I was 13 years old, I have gained extensive experience in several fields.
I currently primarily specialize in mobile application development with years of experience in Flutter and Java. I also have experience 
working with Python, particularly with Flask and FastAPI for backend services, and building web applications using Bootstrap 
and JavaScript (with jQuery or Three.js). Recently, my interests have expanded to include Rust and embedded systems,
particularity the Slint UI framework, areas where I am actively developing my expertise.

I also love Linux, I manage several Ubuntu servers and use Kubuntu on a daily basis. I also have experience with the Yocto Project on embedded systems.
